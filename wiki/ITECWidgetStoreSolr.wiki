#summary One-Source code for Solr registry for widgets developed for ITEC

SVN:

http://iecbolton.jira.com/svn/ITEC/widget_discovery_service/trunk/

Read the README for instructions on how to run it and play with it. 

The registry gets data out of Wookie and indexes into EN and FR search cores, and then exposes a REST API for searching and browsing.

(This is only a proof-of-concept)
